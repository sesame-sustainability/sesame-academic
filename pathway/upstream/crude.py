Caveat: GREET does not have crude-specific refining emission models built in, and thus we are using an average refining emissions in the process stage, which does not change with the crude type. However, by varying the available crude sulfur content and API knobs in GREET, we found that such variation does not have a very large impact on the refining emissions and even smaller impact on well-to-wheel LCA because the lifecycle GHG emissions are dominated by end-use combustion. The impact is a few percent deviation (lifecycle-wise) from the base case when compared with the extreme cases of sulfur content and API (thus refining efficiency) in GREET.',
